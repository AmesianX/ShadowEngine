# SO Engine (ShadowEngine)
<b>Delphi Firemonkey (FMX) Sprite Engine with Formatters, Animations, Collisions and etc.</b>

Besides work on "SO Engine", now, I'm trying to make Wiki for this project http://dimlight.ru/wiki<br />

<b>My goals for the near future:</b> <br />
  1) End working on Object Initilizer from SEJson(May be SEXML) file. <br />
  2) 100% Ported code for Delphi XE5-XE8, 10-10.1<br />
  3) Clean project repository, for people who want Clone Repository and Start work immediately<br />
  4) Some new features for Formatters, FastFields and more for Math(and not math) Expressions parser.<br />
  
Some engine features you could watch on YouTube:

<i>
Addictive game about confrontation of Humankind and Asteroids.
Your aim is to avoid randomly moving asteroids. You can't shoot them.
There are 3 modes: Story, Survival, Relax.
In story mode level length is from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Every next level is harder.
In Survival new asteroid is spawned every 15 second.</i>
